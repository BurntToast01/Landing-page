        sometimes we have a need to link certain sections of a website.<br>
        Think they call it page sections or contents.<br>
       Give some of the links in the content section a try. Those links should send you
to the exact place of the start of each topic. If, by whatever chance, they're not doing their jobs, please, feel
free to contact your local admin and proceed to complain.

Food:
    <br>
    <img src="static/hungry_food.jpg">
    <p style="font-size:18px; text-align:left">
        You have to understand just how much I enjoy food. Food is a link to the past, a link to when things were simple,
when things were much slower, and we didn't need to worry about too much. The very smell of certain foods has the power
to teleport me back into childhood. My mother in the kitchen had just cracked a few eggs spiced with onions and
a bit of garlic. The fried plantains were just being laid down on the skillet, the sound of the blender going off
finishing off the refried beans. And, young me, with eye crust in my eyes and a rumbling stomach ready to eat
and start the day just right. Thanks to food, I have my own personal time machine, and I hope to never lose it either.
